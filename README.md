##  Abstract of the Project

In the previous project, the main topics discussed were the Forward and Inverse kinematics of the Spherical Manipulator. Other topics included the computations, the essential methods for the solutions, and the development of a graphical user interface with methods that click on either a function for the inverse or the forward kinematics. In this project sequel, the focus will be on the Jacobian Matrix, the Singularities of a manipulator, the Velocity of the manipulator, and the Path and Trajectory needed for the replication of welding and pick and place movement. The goal of the project is to create a complete Calculator with elements such as the velocities and a newer and moving model and to do so, the aforementioned, as well as the previous elements from the previous project, were essential.

## Introduction
In the times of today, modernized industries have utilized the usage of robots to achieve tasks at a certain and desired efficiency for the sake of various aspects such as mass production or quality assurance but ultimately leads to product fabrications. Robots of today have many applications for a variety of tasks, however, certain robots can only do certain tasks and for this project, **The Spherical Manipulator** or Robot will be the main focus. _**The Spherical Manipulator**_ is a manipulator that is made up of two rotary and one prismatic joint and, from the name itself, uses its links to perform spherical motions from a stationary position or fixed standpoint. To analyze the movement of the said manipulator, we use kinematic equations which have two different approaches. The two different approaches are Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics which are tackled in depth in the Forward and Inverse Kinematics section.
