##  Abstract of the Project

In the previous project, the main topics discussed were the Forward and Inverse kinematics of the Spherical Manipulator. Other topics included the computations, the essential methods for the solutions, and the development of a graphical user interface with methods that click on either a function for the inverse or the forward kinematics. In this project sequel, the focus will be on the Jacobian Matrix, the Singularities of a manipulator, the Velocity of the manipulator, and the Path and Trajectory needed for the replication of welding and pick and place movement. The goal of the project is to create a complete Calculator with elements such as the velocities and a newer and moving model and to do so, the aforementioned, as well as the previous elements from the previous project, were essential.

## Introduction
In the previous midterm project, the goal was to discuss the assigned manipulator from its degrees of freedom to its inverse kinematics solution. Ultimately, the project concluded with a **GUI Calculator** for the forward and inverse kinematics together with a model that shows how the manipulator would look and position with given position vectors or joint variables. In this sequel, which is the ***Final Project***, the focus will now shift to advanced topics. The main focus of the Final Project will be the Velocities of the manipulator. Imagine you have a manipulator of any kind and it moves as intended based on the code or desire of the creator; however, even though it moves as intended, you would notice the speed at which the manipulator moves. Sometimes, the manipulator might just be light enough that it can move swiftly but that would be expected as a small manipulator and not one that is large enough for production causes which mainly is what most manipulators are for. A better solution to manipulate the speed of the manipulator would be to incorporate it into a program that can do so wherein one of which is with the use of the ***Jacobian Matrix***.
