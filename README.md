##  Abstract of the Project

The project aimed to create a GUI calculator that is able to solve both Forward and Inverse Kinematics of the Spherical Manipulator. Several discussions and topics were covered which were essential information to have for the creation of the calculator and its functions. Topics such as the Homogeneous Transformation Matrix and Inverse Kinematics with the usage of Graphical Method to obtain the equations necessary. Ultimately, the creation of the GUI Calculator with its desired outputs and conditions were made properly. 

## Introduction
In the times of today, modernized industries have utilized the usage of robots to achieve tasks at a certain and desired efficiency for the sake of various aspects such as mass production or quality assurance but ultimately leads to product fabrications. Robots of today have many applications for a variety of tasks, however, certain robots can only do certain tasks and for this project, **The Spherical Manipulator** or Robot will be the main focus. _**The Spherical Manipulator**_ is a manipulator that is made up of two rotary and one prismatic joint and, from the name itself, uses its links to perform spherical motions from a stationary position or fixed standpoint. To analyze the movement of the said manipulator, we use kinematic equations which have two different approaches. The two different approaches are Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics which are tackled in depth in the Forward and Inverse Kinematics section.
